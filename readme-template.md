- A placeholder of where you're at in project development so it's easier to pick up later


## TODO:
- Task breakdown for what still needs to get done

 

  
## Questions for Team:
- Can keep a log of questions to ask during check in's/ daily syncs


## Questions for Client: 
- For when there is a blocker or you need to ask the client something but can't right away


### Gotchas:
- Known issues or hangups with the project - this can be specifics for API calls to client services, quirks that hubspot may have specific to the project, etc

  

## Discovery Notes
- logs for when the project starts, to help understand project documentation

### What is this integration doing?
- high level overview of project actions

  

### Where is the code going to live?
- deployment environment for production


  

### Bitwarden Authentication Items:
- labels for bitwarden items to retrieve authentication variables


  

### Trigger:
- can be high level view of what will trigger the workflows or serverless functions
- can also be triggers specific to workflows or serverless functions if the project is complicated enough


  
  

## Workflows:
- Notes to help structure each action in workflows/ still working on a serverless function equivalent

### 1) Â Action from process flow diagram or other high level actions for integrations
- a numbered section for each workflow populated with steps for each action needed

Code blocks:
- a list of code blocks for the workflow to help understand what each block is supposed to be doing
- I take the steps from the numbered workflow section and break them down into these code blocks
- [x] <-- using check boxes for each code block to help keep track of development progress (in Obsidian and other note taking apps these brackets become check boxes)


Testing: 
- notes for testing the code blocks, or another list of checkboxes for each code block while testing if you wish 
- this could be a good place to quickly see what is blocking progress on workflows/ emergent gotchas

## Resources:
### Project Documents
    - Links to UTS created documents for the project:
        - integration document
        - miro board
        - discovery documents if needed

  

### Reference Documents:
    - API documentation for 3rd party apis
